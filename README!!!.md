## Description

Love away vacations is a web app dedicated to helping newlyweds and other advocates of love to enjoy traveling the world’s most romantic locations. The ability to create a form allows the user to log their favorite location, restaurants, secrets picnic spots and other adventurous plans. 

User authentication is utilized to enhance the ability to save specific details of trips dedicated to specific cities of love. React router was used on the front end to design the routes coordinating the flow of information uploaded by the user. 

The city information was populated via the backend database available to categorize the trips. The tag name is an identifying label for the specific form within a city post made by a user. 

Axios was utilized in order to grab the information from the api through a put method versus using a slower get method. 

Through this project, much was accomplished via pair programming, time management daily check in at start of day and throughout to maintain a consistent flow of group communication.

A snag to work out in our project is potentially the update feature which is rather picky about how it allows a user to insert new fields of data without replacing all other information previously loaded in the form. Another bug is the inability to refresh the page despite the submit button following through. While this could be a conflict with surge, or too large of a data collection being passed through the paths that affect how it loads on the page. 

While most of the CSS was controlled in App.js, a few more CSS files were made to accompany the select changes needed to be made in the components/separate pages that rendered differently than the landing page’s information. 

Some of the branches created were made to separate the errors and also helped to understand the process of Git. Const and const-two were made available as copies of the master in case of worst case scenario. Cherry-pick was a learning exercise in Git to isolate certain desired changed. Css-landing and css-landing two were made for the css changes made to suit the final design form of our app.
